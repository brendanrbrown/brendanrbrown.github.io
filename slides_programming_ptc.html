# What you will learn

- write your own functions in R
- if/else statements
- how to make a random tournament bracket


**Main reference:** [R4DS section III](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/program-intro.html), ch 19


---
# Last time: Random bracket program
These should be the basic operations of our program

1. **Input** original tournament state of 64 teams

2. **For each round, do** the following

  a. **Select winners** randomly from the previous round
  
  b. **Return results** from the current round


We ignore the play-in rounds

---
# Last time: `apply` for tourney picker


#### First round

```r
d &lt;- matrix(1:8, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
d
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    2
## [2,]    3    4
## [3,]    5    6
## [4,]    7    8
```

#### Second round

```r
apply(d, 1, sample, size = 1) %&gt;% matrix(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    3
## [2,]    6    8
```

#### Iterate till there is a winner

---
# Scaling up to the real thing

### Team names don't matter
Keep the teams as numbers in the tourney. Later, we'll see how to match the names to numbers so we can fill out the bracket correctly.

### Iteration, saving each intermediate result

- want all results from all rounds so we can fill out an actual bracket
- need a loop to feed the previous round's result (from step 2b) into the next round's matchups (step 2a)
- saving all intermediate steps

### Do this in a clean, consistent way

This is what functions are for...

# No picks to pick this year anyway

# Use your imagination!
Or wait for next year. This is the beauty of the picker program: It works every year!

# Functions

### What are they?
Named R objects that take inputs, performs operations, and returns outputs, e.g. `sin` or `tibble`.

### Why write my own?
Write them to

- complete repetitive tasks
- with variable inputs
- using operations not given by a single pre-existing function
- to give better control on how those inputs are handled within the function
- and avoid errors from copying and pasting, e.g. variable names or types have changed from one line to another

---
# Syntax
Using placeholders for the name `fun_name`, arguments `arg1, arg2 ...` , body `function body`, and function `output`
```
fun_name &lt;- function(arg1, arg2, ...){
  
  function body
  
  return(output)
}
```

### Output

- if you did not have `return`, function returns the last value computed
- to specify what to return, use `return` as above


---
### Specifying default values
Use `=` to specify the value used if the user gives none for that argument

Here, setting `arg2` default to `default_arg`, which could be a number, a string, etc.
```
fun_name &lt;- function(arg1, arg2 = default_arg, ...){
  function body
  
  return(output)
}
```

### Tips from the textbook

1. Pick names carefully: Informative but short, and **don't override existing function names** such as `mean`

2. Use comments (lines starting with `#`) selectively in your function body, to make it more readable and clear. Don't overdo it.

3. Use readable spacing and style. See the textbook [ch 19.4.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#code-style)

---
# Example

$$g(x) = \frac{1}{1+|x|} $$

Specifying the default to be 1

```r
g &lt;- function(x = 1){
  1/(1 + abs(x))
}
```


```r
g(2)
```

```
## [1] 0.3333333
```

Giving no argument invokes the default, if one exists

```r
g()
```

```
## [1] 0.5
```


---
# Example

### Haversine formula from previous class


```r
haversine &lt;- function(lat1, lat2, long1, long2){
  
  # coordinates must be in radians
  h &lt;- sin(.5 * (lat2 - lat1)) ^ 2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * (sin(.5 * (long2 - long1)) ^ 2)
  
  # earth diameter taken from http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/earth_info.html
  r &lt;- (12756/2)*(5/8)
  
  return(2*r*asin(sqrt(h)))
}
```

Distance to Nuuk from Hanes hall

```r
haversine(lat1 = pi*35.910710/180, lat2 = pi*64.182179/180, long1 = pi*-79.051417/180, long2 = pi * -51.688468 / 180)
```

```
## [1] 2276.99
```

---
### Without the `return` statement

```r
haversine &lt;- function(lat1, lat2, long1, long2){
  
  # coordinates must be in radians
  h &lt;- sin(.5 * (lat2 - lat1)) ^ 2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * (sin(.5 * (long2 - long1)) ^ 2)
  
  # earth diameter taken from http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/earth_info.html
  r &lt;- (12756/2)*(5/8)
  
  2*r*asin(sqrt(h))
}
```

In this simple function, it's fine not to specify `return`.

```r
haversine(lat1 = pi*35.910710/180, lat2 = pi*64.182179/180, long1 = pi*-79.051417/180, long2 = pi * -51.688468 / 180)
```

```
## [1] 2276.99
```

---
# Function environments
Say we want to write a function for 
$$g(y, x) = \frac{1}{1 + |y|+|x|} $$

and write it like this

```r
g &lt;- function(x = 1){
  1/(1 + abs(y) + abs(x))
}
```

#### Notice we did not give `y` as an argument, even though it is used in the function. What happens?

#### This is bad and we'll see why

---
### Where does a function look for objects?
'Lexical scoping' in rough terms. See more in R4DS ch 19.7 and [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#lexical-scoping)

- function looks for objects within itself first: function arguments and objects created within the function
- if that fails: looks for objects one level up, usually the 'global environment'
- global environment is what you see in R Studio in the top right corner

### Example

`y` is not an argument of my function `g`. But if I do


```r
y &lt;- 2
g(x = 1)
```

```
## [1] 0.25
```

this is `\(g(2, 1) = \frac{1}{1 + |2|+|1|} = 1/4\)`

---
# Best practice

Calling objects from the global environment within a function is not ideal. 

A key goal of functions is to control the inputs and outputs for an operation, so that you get correct results and avoid goofs.

Instead, **a good practice is to write functions using only the objects given as arguments or defined in the function body.**


```r
g &lt;- function(y, x = 1){
  1/(1 + abs(y) + abs(x))
}
```

#### Priority given to object within function
even if something with the same name is defined outside the function. **This gives consistency!**


```r
y &lt;- 2
g(y = 3, x = 1)
```

```
## [1] 0.2
```


---
# Conditionals: if/else

### Syntax
Logical conditions help build more complex functions. Placeholder `condition` here should evaluate to a **single `TRUE` or `FALSE`** logical value.

```
if (condition) {
  code executed when condition is TRUE
} else {
  code executed when condition is FALSE
}
```

Nest multiple if/else statements using 

```
if (condition1) {
  code executed when condition1 is TRUE
} else if (condition2) {
  code executed when condition1 is FALSE and condition 2 is TRUE
} else {
  code executed when condition1 and condition2 are FALSE
}
```

---
# Example
Dummy examples


```r
if (TRUE){
  print("I KNEW IT")
} else {
  print("BUT WHY NOT?")
}
```

```
## [1] "I KNEW IT"
```



```r
if (FALSE){
  print("I KNEW IT")
} else {
  print("BUT WHY NOT?")
}
```

```
## [1] "BUT WHY NOT?"
```

---
# Example: Haversine units
Say we want the option to output haversine distance in kilometers, rather than miles.

Add an argument to the function that is a logical condition indicating this. Default is in miles.


```r
haversine &lt;- function(lat1, lat2, long1, long2, in_km = FALSE){
  
  # coordinates must be in radians
  h &lt;- sin(.5 * (lat2 - lat1)) ^ 2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * (sin(.5 * (long2 - long1)) ^ 2)
  
  # earth diameter taken from http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/earth_info.html
  # NASA calc uses 5/8 km to mi conversion rather than 0.621371
  if (in_km){
    r &lt;- 12756/2
  } else {
    r &lt;- (12756/2)*(5/8)
  }
  
  2*r* asin(sqrt(h))
  
}
```

---
### Great-circle approximate distance to Nuuk, in km

```r
haversine(lat1 = pi * 35.910710 / 180, lat2 = pi * 64.182179 / 180, long1 = pi * -79.051417 / 180, long2 = pi * -51.688468 / 180,
          in_km = T)
```

```
## [1] 3643.184
```

### [Answer from NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/special/): 3639.2 km

# Tutorial
In this tutorial, we will create a function that executes **one round of our tourney picker**, meaning one iteration of step 2 in the program statement above.

This is just an exercise in taking code you have already created and turning it into a function. See the 'Last time:...' slides for a hint of what to do in the function body.

**Create a function called `play`** that does the following

- accepts a single argument (input), a matrix representing matchups between teams
- randomly selects winners from each matchup
- **if** there is more than one winner (in other words, the matchup input is not the last one of the tournament): **return** a matrix of the next round's matchups
- **else** there is only one winner, the tournament champion, so **return** the single winner

*Hint: Do not over-complicate this. The code in the function body can essentially be copied and pasted from the 'Last time:...' slides above. The only task here is to put everything into a function. The only new thing is the if/else statement for what to return.*

# Putting it all together

### Our function
1. **Input** original tournament state of 64 teams

2. **For each round, do** the following

  a. **Select winners** randomly from the previous round
  
  b. **Return results** from the current round

### What we have

- a function `play` that executes one iteration of step 2


---
### Team names don't matter

- since we are choosing randomly, we can assign each team a number `1:64`
- then run the tournament with our picker, as above
- match actual team names to their numbers, so that original matchups are correct
- and so that 'East', 'West' etc. matchups will be correct in the final four

e.g. if UNC played UCLA in the first round, we might have UNC assigned to team 1, UCLA assigned to team 2 in the data frame below


```r
d
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    2
## [2,]    3    4
## [3,]    5    6
## [4,]    7    8
```

---

### Loop through 'play'
Since team names don't matter, we can iterate the `play` function with a for loop until we have a winner.

Since we are halving the number of teams at each round, a valid tournament must have `\(2^k\)` teams for some integer `\(k \ge 1\)`. In our case, `\(2^6 = 64\)`.

So we will need to use `play` for six rounds.

# Tutorial
Add the following to your HTML file

Use the `play` function and the preceding description to write a program that randomly selects winners in the NCAA tournament. Your function must return the results of all interim rounds.

The results should be returned as a list, where each element of the list represents the matchups for each round of the tournament (including the first one) and the final winner. Therefore, your list will have `\(6 + 1 = 7\)` elements.

You need only return the number placehold values for teams. The results do not need to include the team names themselves --- since there aren't even any teams playing this year!
