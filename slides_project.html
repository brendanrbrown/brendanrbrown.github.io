# Now you try!
.center[![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/26/0z/p0260z5q.jpg)]

---

### Semester-long project

--

### Worth 55 percent of course grade

--

### Split into small pieces

--

### Each person has distinct roles

--

### You will hold each other accountable

--

### These slides are your official instructions



---
# Deliverables

These mimic the main deliverables in a data science project.

All materials **submitted on Sakai.**

### Proposal
#### Due: Monday March 2 at 2:30 pm

### Report on data exploration and cleaning
#### Due: Wednesday April 8 at 2:30 pm

### Final report
#### Due: Friday April 24 at 5:00 pm

### Final presentation
#### Due: Final class period and scheduled exam time

---
# Note on the final presentation

Just like in a final exam

- **you must be present**
- unless you have a pre-approved excuse
- even if you are not the main presenter
- since I or your classmates might have questions you are best qualified to answer for your group

---
# Roles

### I randomly choose groups

--

### Assignments posted on sakai

--

### Four roles in each group

--

### You decide who does what

--

### Decide these soon: Read these slides again to know your duties

--

### Each role is the lead for some deliverable

--

### But everyone contributes to each deliverable

---
# Lead vs. support

### Each role is assigned to be the lead in a project deliverable

--

### Final presentation is split in two
- Lead speaker, meaning main person to present in person
- Lead creator for visuals, slides, website or other presentation materials

--

### Everyone else has a support role for that deliverable

--

### Share the load, regardless of role

--

### Delegate amongst yourselves in whatever way you deem best

# Role description

--

**Guide** project scope and direction throughout the semester but particularly early on

--

**Point of contact** for instructor and TA

--

**Ultimately responsible** for turning in work, making sure the team is making progress toward stated goals

--

**Take the long view** and evaluate the project from an outsider's perspective, asking

are these questions valid and interesting?

is our strategy for answering them fruitful?

what have other people done on this topic?

---
class: center, inverse, middle
# Tasks

--

**Meet** with me or TA **by Friday Feb. 28** to discuss proposal. Others are encouraged to attend but the Captain is required. Roles must be assigned by that time.

Schedule this early: Last-minute meeting requests are unlikely to work

--

**Attend all** subsequent meetings with me or the TA for the project. See below.

--

**Lead project proposal**, in collaboration with group, by

determining initial questions

identifying possible datasets


--

**Lead speaker** in final presentation

--

**Submit** all project deliverables on Sakai for the group.

class: center
# Role description


--

**Reveal** patterns and hidden information in the data through exploration and transformation of variables

--

**Resolve** data quality issues, clearly defining limitations of analysis

--

**Refine** initial questions and scope, seeking additional data if needed




---
class: center
# Tasks

--

**Lead** data exploration and cleaning deliverable

--

**Meet** with me or the TA in early March to discuss exploratory analysis. All are encouraged to attend but the *Doctor and Captain are required.*

--

**Direct and coordinate** the creation of descriptive summaries, graphs

--

**Troubleshoot** data quality, structure and importation problems with teammates throughout the semester

---
class: center, inverse, middle
# Role description

--

**Imagine** types of analysis to help project achieve its goals, e.g. 

clustering methods to aid exploratory analysis

model to predict outcome of interest

--

**Devise and implement** models and methods best suited to the analysis

--

**Bring technical expertise** to the project in statistical analysis and modeling, e.g. 

proper cross-validation techniques 

correct interpretation of summary statistics, model output and uncertainty

---
class: center, inverse, middle
# Tasks

--

**Lead** final report creation. Much of what is *new* in the final report will be analysis, modeling and interpretation.

--

**Meet** with me or the TA well before the final report is due to discuss analysis methods and conclusions. All are encouraged to attend by the *Engineer and Captain are required*.


--

**Guide** final project conclusions to ensure technical correctness and validity

class: center
# Role description


--

**Present** your group's work to the world in the best possible light

--

**Cook up trickery** to stimulate the viewers' minds and help them see your project's conclusions, e.g.

interesting summaries

effective graphs

bells and whistles, e.g. Shiny

--

**Massage** each report's look and the information presented therein, by

choosing information presented wisely

ensuring succinct, clear and correct writing

--

**Seek out** interesting and effective ways to present your group's work , e.g.

maps

interactive features


---
class: center
# Tasks

--

**Lead** creation of final presentation materials

--

**Determine** which graphs and summaries in the final presentation that best communicate the group's work and conclusions

--

**Assist teamates in visual communication** through effective, clear and good-looking plots, maps etc.




---
# Determine your roles soon

--

### At latest by the time your Captain meets with me to discuss the proposal

--

### Roles define structure and accountability

--

### All members should be involved in setting project goals

--

### Everyone should feel empowered to participate in activities they enjoy


---
# Weird situations

### Five-person groups

Two people can share a role

Except for Captain 

There can be only one Captain

### Someone drops out, is incapacitated etc.

Contact me as soon as possible, and we will re-evaluate duties

### Group member non-responsive, fails to do tasks etc.

Again, a group member should contact me as soon as possible to resolve the situation.


#### Failure to contribute, to do the tasks to which you have committed could lead to your removal from the group and requirement to start your own project from scratch
This is truly a last-resort option. I will only use it after consultation with each group member. However, I will not hesitate to use it if the situation warrants, even late in the semester.

# Evaluation: Overview

--

### Proposal (10 points)

--

### Exploratory analysis (20 points)

--

### Final report (40 points)


--

### Final presentation (30 points)


---


### Objective criteria

- Meet specific requirements for each deliverable and follow instructions
- Technical correctness of conclusions, methods and coding

--

### Subjective criteria

- Scope and ambition of project
- Creativity of approach and effort of the team
- Effectiveness of communication in written and oral reports, including meetings with me or TA
- Analysis and discussion of any limitations or uncertainty

---

### Peer reviews

Will anonymously rate groupmates on team citizenship *not ability*, meaning: showing up to meetings on time, doing what they said they would do, fulfilling their roles etc.

Ratings on a simple scale (rubric given later) will act as multipliers on your final individual score

**Max:** 1.05 for those who went where no person has gone before

**Min:** 0 for the person who failed to do any work or communicate with the team


---
# Evaluation: Proposal (10 points)

--

## Proposed questions (4 points)

--

### At least 5 interesting initial questions to investigate or goals to achieve

These should be more than the simple 'how many' types of questions you ask in exploration

Should require more than simple grouped summary tables to answer, for example

A goal could be to develop a model to predict some outcome or to classify new observations, for example

--

### Give motivation for questions, make clear why the chosen datasets will help to answer them

---

## Data and data sources (3 points)

--

### Stock datasets, from `R` packages, are not allowed

--

### Kaggle, UCI machine learning repository, other standard datasets highly discouraged

--

### Datasets must be rich enough plausibly to answer questions
You can add or remove datasets later in the semester, but should not change the overall direction and scope of the project

--

### Brief summary information of the dataset
Source, content, etc. Not a full exploratory analysis.

---

## Methods and scope (2 points)

--

### Initial ideas for how to answer questions, achieve goals


Includes types of visual elements to consider, other types of data you would like to have, and models that might be appropriate

This does not need to determine what you ultimately do. Just demonstrate that you have thought about an approach to the problem.

--

## Brief description of related work (1 point)
Includes links to and brief descriptions of projects that have attempted similar goals, and of the extent to which your project will differ or be similar.

For example, if you are doing a project to analyze election polling data, you could evaluate a couple of examples of work at https://fivethirtyeight.com/.

---
# Evaluation: Other

Details will be posted for each item as the date nears

But with plenty of time before the due date

I will raise these briefly in class



---
# Format of reports

### In general

Submit R Markdown **html AND Rmd** files

Unlike in homework

- show only output, not code, unless the code itself is relevant

- submit Rmd files along with html

Written and visual expression really matters

Final work can include extras if you wish, such as interactive graphics. These are not required, however.

### Format of final presentation

A short presentation, e.g. 8-10 minutes

Slides or web-based

Will give details as the date approaches
