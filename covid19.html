# Rest of the course under COVID 19 restrictions

# Overview

### Courses will be held online: Download zoom by March 24

- [Download zoom and test it](https://software.sites.unc.edu/zoom/) by March 24, or email me if you cannot
- I will live-stream the class at the regularly scheduled time
- you will connect to zoom meetings (class periods, office hours etc.) using links I provide through sakai messages

### Project-related assignments and deadlines stand

- Nothing in the project requires you to be on-campus
- I will share details on the next assignment (EDA) soon


### Final project presentation dates stand, extension for EDA TBD

### Unless otherwise noted, all course practices remain

# Our goal is fun through learning

Even more important when everything is topsy turvy.

# Changes: Lectures, tutorials

### Key points

- attendance not mandatory **except for special guest lectures**
- tutorials will be assigned by random selection, with a 24-hour timeline to submit responses
- I will work through the tutorials by sharing my screen as part of the lectures

### Idea is to have a

- less-structured course
- centered around small but regular tutorial exercises
- which I demonstrate how to solve in real time for students who attend the lectures via zoom




---
# New tutorial policies

1. **I will choose 15 people randomly** for each tutorial to submit a response to the exercises given in class

2. **Sakai messages will inform everyone of who is chosen,** and name drawings will happen at the end of class as usual

3. **Due within 24 hours of the class period in which it was assigned**, e.g. a tutorial assigned on Wednesday is due by Thursday at 3:20pm Eastern Standard Time

4. You will have some time, ideally a day, to review the lectures slides to determine if you want to see me go over the material including walking through the tutorial

# Lecture structure

### Format

- **held at the regularly scheduled time**
- plan to use zoom, and you will access the meeting **using a link I provide through Sakai messages**
- [download zoom and test it](https://software.sites.unc.edu/zoom/) by March 24
- if that fails, I'll use my backup plan and will inform you by sakai message

### Attendance policy

- attendance will not be taken, **except at special guest lectures**
- you will have at least a week's notice on the date of guest lectures
- these will be few: at least one, possibly more

### Why attend?

- ask me questions about material on the slides
- ask me questions about how to complete tutorials
- watch me work through the problems with you

# Project

### Not much changes
All due dates and assignments as part of the final project are still due, except for an extension on the EDA which I will annouce. See the instructions on the course website for those dates.

I'll share details on the next piece soon.

### Final presentation
At the moment, these are still due to be given during the scheduled final exam period and on the final day of class. They will be presented online via zoom.

### Important caveat
The university administration has not issued any guidance about the final exam schedule under this new scenario. If these are issued, the time of our presentations might change. But if at all possible, I will make time for the final presentations.

---
# Homework and office hours

### Homework: Nothing changes here
Still assigned and due on sakai

### My office hours

- will happen at the regularly scheduled time
- again through zoom, accessed by **a link I provide through sakai message**

### TA office hours

Working with the TA to determine and will update when I know

# FAQ
The university has given very little clarity about how to handle the many predictable issues students will face at this time, particularly after its decision to force students off campus.

You have my sympathy, and I will do what I can to help you. 

But **some questions are just not for me to answer. Doing so on an ad-hoc basis would be deeply unfair** to your classmates.

### Some reasonable as yet unanswered questions


- Will the final exam schedule be the same?
- What if I am in a different time zone and can never, practically, attend class?
- What if I have poor or nonexistent internet access for the foreseeable future?
- What if my ITS laptop breaks, and I am off campus, away from ITS services?
- What if I get sick for an extended period of time?

### They are university policy questions and not for me to answer. Contact these people
The university has an [FAQ website](https://www.unc.edu/coronavirus/students-and-parents-faqs/#chapter-10), but as of now it does not answer those and many other relevant questions.

- UNC COVID hotline: 919-445-5000 open M-F 10am to 4pm Eastern time
- Dean of students: odos@unc.edu or 919-966-4042
- Chancellor: chancellor@unc.edu

On the chancellor contact: I do not think you will get a response, but I put this here in case you are not getting the answers you need elsewhere.

If you are in need of solid answers to these or similar questions, keep pestering them. I don't see what else will make them do their jobs.
