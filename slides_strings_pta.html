*GASTON: How can you read this? There's no pictures!* 
*BELLE: Well, some people use their imaginations.*

# Beauty of strings

- So much **interesting data** is in text format
- Essential for **data cleaning** when all else fails
- Maximum **flexibility** for manipulating information in structured or unstructured formats
- Regular expressions, the core 'language' of string manipulation, is **widely used** across programming languages


#### This might be tough for some of you, but it is absolutely necessary to learn

# Dataset: Entire script for 'Beauty and the Beast'
I found this Pudding post [analyzing gender roles in Disney scripts](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/index.html) inspiring and neat.

We can also get the entire script for this movie online in text format.

### read_lines

`read_lines` is useful for reading data whose format you don't know or that is not as nice as a csv, e.g. a csv with a stupid irrelevant header.


```r
read_lines('http://www.fpx.de/fp/Disney/Scripts/BeautyAndTheBeast.txt')
```

### Skip lines, or read a max up to a certain line

```r

           skip = 6, n_max = 3)
```

```

```

#### Before we can do anything with this, we need some basic string manipulation skills.

# Patterns and matching

### Pattern
For now, a specific string such as `apple`. Soon we will use **regular expressions** to define more flexible patterns, e.g. ones for any word beginning with `a`.

### Matching
`grep` and `grepl` search each element of a character vector for a pattern.

#### Returns the indices where pattern is matched
```
grep(pattern, character_vector, value = FALSE)
```

#### Returns the vector of matched strings
```
grep(pattern, character_vector, value = TRUE)
```

#### Returns logical vector checking whether pattern is matched
```
grepl(pattern, character_vector)
```

---

```r
talk &lt;- c("one fish", "two fish", "red fish", "blue fish", 
          "blue fisherman", "blue FISH", "red frish", "red turfish")
```


```r
grep("blue", talk, value = FALSE)
```

```
## [1] 4 5 6
```


```r
grep("blue", talk, value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "blue fish"      "blue fisherman" "blue FISH"
```



```r
grepl("blue", talk)
```

```
## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

---
### Case sensitive by default


```r
grep("FISH", talk, value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "blue FISH"
```


```r
grep("FISH", talk, ignore.case = TRUE, value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "one fish"       "two fish"       "red fish"       "blue fish"     
## [5] "blue fisherman" "blue FISH"      "red turfish"
```

### Partial matches work so long as the pattern is not disrupted

e.g. `turfish` and `fisherman` match to `fish`, but `frish` doesn't

# Tutorial
Create an html file that does the following

1. Load the first 10 lines of actual text in the beauty and the beast script, **skipping the first 6 in the file**.
2. return a vector of lines matching the pattern `old woman`. Return the actual text.
3. return a vector of lines matching the word `but` regardless of case. Return the actual text.

# Cleaning the data
To make for better examples, I have put the script into a data frame with two columns: `speaker` and `line`. Here is the code I used. Don't worry if it's still just nonsense.

```r
beauty &lt;- read_lines('http://www.fpx.de/fp/Disney/Scripts/BeautyAndTheBeast.txt', skip = 6) %&gt;% 
  str_trim(side = "both") %&gt;% paste(collapse = ";") %&gt;% str_replace_all(c(" \\(ex. COGSWORTH\\):" = ":", " \\(esp. LUMIERE\\):" = ":"))
# little annoying or statement for MRS. POTTS. Can't rearrage the previous statement without getting more
codes &lt;- unique(str_extract_all(beauty, "[A-Z]+[\\s0-9[:punct:]]*:|MRS. POTTS:|OLD CRONIES:")[[1]])
codes_list &lt;- paste0(seq(from = 100, to = 100 + length(codes) - 1), "&gt;")
names(codes_list) &lt;- codes
beauty &lt;- str_replace_all(beauty, codes_list) %&gt;% 
  str_replace("&lt;/pre&gt;", "") %&gt;%
  # first removing the directions between two brackets
  str_replace_all("(\\(){1}[A-Za-z0-9\\s,.;:'!?]*(\\)){1}", "") %&gt;%
  # now getting the dangling brackets with open ends at the end of the line or dangling brackets
  str_replace_all("(\\(){1}[A-Za-z0-9\\s,.;:'!?]*(\\))*", "")
beauty &lt;- tibble(person = str_extract_all(beauty, "[0-9]{3}&gt;")[[1]],
                     line = str_extract_all(beauty, "[A-z[:punct:][:space:]]+(?![0-9]{3}&gt;)")[[1]])
names(codes) &lt;- codes_list
beauty &lt;- mutate(beauty, person = str_replace_all(person, codes) %&gt;% str_replace_all(":", ""),
                 line = str_trim(line, side = "both") %&gt;% str_replace_all(";+", " ") %&gt;% str_trim)
```

# Counting and replacing matches

`str_count` counts the number of times *in each cell* a pattern appears, returning a vector of integers



```r
str_count(c("one fish", "fish fish", "fishfishfish", "wish"), "fish")
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 0
```

`str_replace` replaces the **first** matched value with an alternative


```r
str_replace(c("one fish", "fish fish", "fishfishfish", "wish"), "fish", "dog")
```

```
## [1] "one dog"     "dog fish"    "dogfishfish" "wish"
```

`str_replace_all` replaces the **all** matched occurances with an alternative


```r
str_replace_all(c("one fish", "fish fish", "fishfishfish", "wish"), "fish", "dog")
```

```
## [1] "one dog"   "dog dog"   "dogdogdog" "wish"
```

---
`str_trim` is a handy utility that eliminates whitespace on the ends of strings, which is usually annoying.

Does nothing here

```r
str_trim(c("one fish", "fish fish", "fishfishfish", "wish"))
```

```
## [1] "one fish"     "fish fish"    "fishfishfish" "wish"
```

but handy in this situation


```r
str_trim(c("        one fish      ", "   fish   fish   ", "  fishfishfish   ", "   wish"))
```

```
## [1] "one fish"     "fish   fish"  "fishfishfish" "wish"
```

---
# Example: Be our guest

#### How many times does the phrase `be our guest` appear?
`str_count` does not have `ignore.case` argument. There is a way to do it, but we'll see it later. For now, do this

```r
tolower(beauty$line) %&gt;% str_count("be our guest") %&gt;% sum
```

```
## [1] 14
```


---
#### Can that be true? Seems like they say it so many times...
Use `grepl` in a filter

```r
filter(beauty, grepl("be our guest", line, ignore.case = T))
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   person  line

1. **Copy and paste** the cleaning code above that creates the `beauty` data frame for the script.
2. **Count** the number of times `Gaston` is mentioned *in total* throughout the movie.
3. **Display** a data frame that gives the number of times `Gaston` is mentioned *by each person*, removing rows for people who never say `Gaston`
