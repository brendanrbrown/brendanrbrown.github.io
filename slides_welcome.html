# Welcome to STOR 320, section one

---


# Purpose

Our world is [full](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) of [data](https://www.data.gov/).

Data science is a portal to [new knowledge](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/12/16/methodology-30/) and [opportunities](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-7/big-data-adds-up.htm).

You will become part of a large and growing [community](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) exploring and using data in [industry](https://deepmind.com/), [academia](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/), [government](https://usajobs.github.io/microsite-data-science/), [news media](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), and in simply satisfying their curiosity. 

Applications range from theoretical, to financial, to [ecological](https://www.itreetools.org/), to [political](https://jobs.lever.co/dnc/5cac9dbb-9258-4c4a-9398-45d651d8950b), to [cultural](https://pudding.cool/).

They can be [benevolent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/20/opioid-files/?arc404=true), [nefarious](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/07/dating-apps-need-women-advertisers-need-diversity-ai-companies-offer-solution-fake-people/) or [meaningless](https://viz.wtf/).

Talented people around the world have given their time to [developing](https://mc-stan.org/) [open](https://www.python.org/)-[source](https://www.r-project.org/) [tools](https://juliacomputing.com/) for this purpose.

If learned well, these skills can be a source of satisfaction and empowerment throughout your lives---even if you do not ultimately pursue careers in this field.

# What you will learn
### Core programming and data science skills
- data frame creation and manipulation
- exploratory data analysis, summary stats, graphs with `ggplot2`
- 'tidy' and relational, combining datasets
- functions and functional programming
- string manipulation, regex

### Modeling 
- cross-validation
- classification techniques
- clustering

### Advanced topics, e.g. (time permitting)
- mapping 
- Shiny for interactive applications
- advanced modeling 
- industry and ethics

# Course philosophy

![](makerseye.png)

---

### Jump into the fire with enthusiasm!

- Each section revolves around a **real dataset**.

- Will reveal rather than hide **problems with these datasets**, in general.

- Attempt to give a realistic picture of data science projects as they occur in the wild.

### I demonstrate, you emulate

- Almost every lecture has an **in-class tutorial**.

- Culminates in a self-directed group project to **explore something you find interesting** with data science tools.



### Do not get discouraged 
You must spend a lot of time and suffer many failures to become a good programmer and data analyst.

*Do not mistake composure for ease.*


  *--- Lt. Tuvok*

You should expect to work hard. Those who excel and make this look simple have put many hours into practice.

# Golden rule

### Make the class better not worse for others

### You're making it worse if you...

- show up late
- come and go often during lectures
- watch videos during class
- ask me for an arbitrary grade bump at the end of the semester

### You're making it better if you...

- help a classmate with a tutorial or homework
- ask good questions in class
- make a genuine effort to solve problems, even if you fail

---
# What you need for the class

### Textbooks
Both free online.

- Core programming: [R for data science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- Modeling: [Introduction to statistical learning (ISLR)](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)

### Laptops

- Bring your laptop to each class
- You will need to download *R* and *R Studio*, both free
- See the first homework assignment, which is just to install those by Friday


Come talk to me after class if you do not have a laptop.

---
# Lectures

### Webpage
With lecture slides and other materials: [brendanrbrown.github.io](brendanrbrown.github.io)

### Day to day
- Will post lectures day-of on the website
- Most sections are several lectures long
- Generally one real dataset explored per section
- Data from a variety of topic areas and sources, e.g. ecology, art, movies, history, sciences

---
# Grading

### Tutorials and participation (10 %)
### Homework (35 %)
### Project (55 %)

---
# Tutorials

### What they are
- I ask you to emulate tasks I just showed
- Roughly one tutorial per class, split into parts
- Instructions in lecture slides posted on the website

### How to complete them
- Expect everyone to participate earnestly
- **Do these without my help**, pushing you to use the internet, other resources
- Groups of maximimum three people **sitting next to you**
- **Each person must complete their own** assignment
- Particular format, which I will detail next time
- First one we do together

---

### How they are evaluated
- Randomly sample 10 people to email me their work during class
- **Graded for effort and completion** not excellence
- If you demonstrate a genuine effort to solve the problems, you receive full credit

### Participation
Tutorials make up the bulk of your 'tutorial and participation' grade

I reserve the right to mark down the participation grade for students who **habitually disrupt class**, e.g. by talking loudly, showing up late.

---
# Homework

- Assigned **weekly**, usually

- Posted on the github site

- Submit on Sakai

- Must be submitted as an **R Markdown HTML file**

- Files that **do not 'knit' will not be accepted** --- there's probably a bug in your code

- See the syllabus for homework policies

---
# Project
The final project is done in groups of at least 4 and worth a total of 100 points. There will be 4 parts of varying point values submitted throughout the semester. **Groups will be randomly assigned.**

### Part one: Project Proposal
Worth 10 points and will be due sometime in the middle of the semester after groups have been designated. Instructions and a due date will be released later and will give ample time to complete this part.
### Part two: Exploratory Data Analysis
Worth 20 points and will be due sometime towards the end of the semester after the Project Proposal has been completed.

---

### Part three: Final Paper
Worth 40 points and must be submitted on Sakai by 5:00 pm on Friday, April 24.

### Part four: Final Presentation
Worth 30 points and will take place during the course's designated final exam time according to the university calendar. All materials for the presentation must be submitted on sakai by the start of the scheduled exam time.

# Contacting us

### Order of operations

Ask yourself (i.e. really try). Then the internet. Then your friends. Then us.

### Me
Emails sent before 5:00 pm each day are guaranteed a response that day.

Emails sent after 5:00 pm probably won't get answered until the next day


### Taylor
Checks email between 1 pm and 5 pm every day, depending on the day

### Don't email questions at the last minute. You will be :(
