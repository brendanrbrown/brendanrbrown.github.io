# Welcome to STOR 320, section one

# Purpose

Our world is [full](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) of [data](https://www.data.gov/).

Data science is a portal to [new knowledge](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/12/16/methodology-30/) and [opportunities](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-7/big-data-adds-up.htm).

You will become part of a large and growing [community](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) exploring and using data in [industry](https://deepmind.com/), [academia](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/), [government](https://usajobs.github.io/microsite-data-science/), [news media](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), and in simply satisfying their curiosity. 

Applications range from theoretical, to financial, to [ecological](https://www.itreetools.org/), to [political](https://jobs.lever.co/dnc/5cac9dbb-9258-4c4a-9398-45d651d8950b), to [cultural](https://pudding.cool/).

They can be [benevolent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/20/opioid-files/?arc404=true), [nefarious](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/07/dating-apps-need-women-advertisers-need-diversity-ai-companies-offer-solution-fake-people/) or [meaningless](https://viz.wtf/).

Talented people around the world have given their time to [developing](https://mc-stan.org/) [open](https://www.python.org/)-[source](https://www.r-project.org/) [tools](https://juliacomputing.com/) for this purpose.

If learned well, these skills can be a source of satisfaction and empowerment throughout your lives---even if you do not ultimately pursue careers in this field.

# What you will learn
### Core programming and data science skills
- data frame creation and manipulation
- exploratory data analysis, summary stats, graphs with `ggplot2`
- 'tidy' and relational, combining datasets
- functions and functional programming
- string manipulation, regex

### Modeling 
- cross-validation
- classification techniques
- clustering

### Advanced topics, e.g. (time permitting)
- mapping 
- Shiny for interactive applications
- advanced modeling 
- industry and ethics

# Course philosophy

![](makerseye.png)

---

### Jump into the fire with enthusiasm!

- Each section revolves around a **real dataset**.

- Will reveal rather than hide **problems with these datasets**, in general.

- Attempt to give a realistic picture of data science projects as they occur in the wild.

### I demonstrate, you emulate

- Almost every lecture has an **in-class tutorial**.

- Culminates in a self-directed group project to **explore something you find interesting** with data science tools.



### Do not get discouraged 
You must spend a lot of time and suffer many failures to become a good programmer and data analyst.

*Do not mistake composure for ease.*


  *--- Lt. Tuvok*

You should expect to work hard. Those who excel and make this look simple have put many hours into practice.

# What you need for the class

### Textbooks
Both free online.

- Core programming: [R for data science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- Modeling: [Introduction to statistical learning (ISLR)](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)

### Computer, decent internet

- if you are having technical issues, let me know ASAP and I will help you investigate university resources to help you
- you will need to download *R* and *R Studio*, both free


---
# Lectures

### Webpage
With lecture slides and other materials: [brendanrbrown.github.io](brendanrbrown.github.io)

### Day to day
- **pre-recorded lectures** for asynchronous instruction
- all lectures posted at the start!
- one video per 'lecture' slide deck
- core of the class is watching me work through tutorial problems on video, doing it yourself

---
# Grading

### Tutorials (15 %)
### Homework (30 %)
### Project (55 %)

---
# Tutorials

### What they are
- I ask you to emulate tasks I just showed
- Roughly one tutorial per lecture slide deck
- Instructions in lecture slides posted on the website

### How to complete them
- **Do these without my help**, pushing you to use the internet, other resources
- But I will give you **ample help in my demos during videos and sample code in slides**
- Will discuss format more specifically in the first tutorial demo

---

### How they are evaluated
- **Graded for effort and completion** not excellence
- If you demonstrate a genuine effort to solve the problems, you receive full credit

### Emailed to IA Wan Zhang at wanz63@live.unc.edu      

### Do not skimp on these
      
### They are the core of the class, and a low-key way to become good at this

---
# Homework

- Assigned **weekly**, usually

- Posted on the github site

- Submit on Sakai

- Must be submitted as an **R Markdown HTML file**

- Files that **do not 'knit' will not be accepted** --- there's probably a bug in your code

- See the syllabus for homework policies

---
# Project
The final project is done in groups of at least two and worth a total of 100 points.
      
Details in the semester project instructions lecture.
      
### Part one: Proposal and exploration
Worth 30 points, due mid-semester.

---

### Part two: Final Paper
Worth 40 points and will be due last day of class, June 15

### Part four: Final Presentation
Worth 30 points and will take place during the course's designated final exam time according to the university calendar.

# Contacting us

### Order of operations

Ask yourself (i.e. really try). Then the internet. Then your friends. Then us.

### Emailing me
Emails sent before 5:00 pm Eastern each day are guaranteed a response that day

Emails sent after 5:00 pm probably won't get answered until the next day


### Don't email questions at the last minute. You will be :(
