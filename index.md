These will be posted as they become relevant.

## Resources

Our textbook for programming is [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and for modeling is [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).

[R studio cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are a good place to start. [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) has a lot of good information, too, but probably more than you need.

Become good at Googling your problems.

## Examples in data science
These link to examples I mention in class, which might help give context for the kinds of data and analysis you can use in the project.


|Date | Example |
|------|-------|
|Jan. 10| [Sermons](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/12/16/the-digital-pulpit-a-nationwide-analysis-of-online-sermons/) |
