Welcome to section one of the spring 2020 course.

## Who we are

Brendan Brown (instructor) and 
Taylor Petty (TA)

## About the course
See the [syllabus](syllabus_stor320_1.pdf) for details. The course is divided into three parts,

1. Core data science coding skills
2. Modeling
3. Advanced topics (as time allows)




## Lectures
These will be posted as they become relevant. You will have laptops in class, but my advice is to be diligent and stay focused on the lecture material.

Trying to do other stuff while participating in a lecture is very 2010s. In the 2020s, we should all be aware that multitasking [does not work](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/creativity-without-borders/201405/the-myth-multitasking) and [might even be bad for you](https://appliedpsychologydegree.usc.edu/blog/to-multitask-or-not-to-multitask/).

|Jan. 8 | [hw 0](hw0.html) | Jan. 10|

## Semester-long project
These slides contain instructions on role, grading criteria, and deliverables: [Semester project](slides_project.html)

They will be updated with details for each project piece as its due date nears.

The project is divided into four pieces

- Proposal: Due March 2, 2:30 pm
- Data exploration and cleaning report: Due April 8, 2:30 pm
- Final report: Due April 24, 5:00 pm
- Final presentation: Last day of classes and university-designated final exam time

You will be randomly assigned to a group, typically of four people. **Assignments are posted on Sakai** under Resources. Each student has a distinct role in the group, which groups choose for themselves.




## Resources

Our textbook for programming is [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and for modeling is [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).

[R studio cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are a good place to start. [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) has a lot of good information, too, but probably more than you need.

Become good at Googling your problems.

## Examples in data science
These link to examples I mention in class, which might help give context for the kinds of data and analysis you can use in the project.
