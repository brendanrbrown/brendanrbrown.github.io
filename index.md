## About the course
See the [syllabus](syllabus_stor320_su1.pdf) for details. The course is divided into three rough parts,

1. Core data science coding skills
2. Modeling
3. Advanced topics


## Lectures and tutorials

**Lectures will not be held live and will be pre-recorded.** Videos are available through the Sakai page.

Each video is associated with a single set of slides and accompanying tutorial. However, a single 'day' of lectures often will cover two or more videos and slides. This is necessary because of the condensed summer session timeline.

Each slide deck and video is associated with a short exercise, called a tutorial. See the syllabus for details.

**Tutorials from all of the material covered for a given day will be due by the start of the next scheduled course period.** This could mean you have multiple tutorials to complete in a 24-hour period.

For example, 

- tutorials from the lecture slides/videos associated with the Thursday May 14 class would be due by 9:45 am on Friday May 15
- tutorials from the lecture slides/videos in the Friday May 15 class would be due by 9:45 am on Monday May 18

## Lecture guide
This will help you keep track of which lecture slides and videos are associated with which date of instruction. Videos are posted on Sakai.

**Note: You won't be able to generate slides from the .Rmd for the final videos without the xaringan packge**, but they're not really meant to be viewed as slides anyway. Just strip the code you need, if any, from the files.

### Data sources
I will post some sites here that are good options for finding datasets. 

The list is a work in progress. I will add to it as I feel moved to do so. If you find something neat, email me and I can add it. 

A good way to find datasets is to look for data science projects, e.g. [at the Pudding](pudding.cool), where they either will provide a link to the data or at least give a source.

- [Bureau of Economic Analysis API for R](https://github.com/us-bea/bea.R)
- [Census API for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/censusapi/vignettes/getting-started.html)
- [Data is plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive)
- [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/download-datasets/)
- [US Census](https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools.html)
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
- [Harvard dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
- [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/)
- [WaPo opioid data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/)
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)
- [Iowa caucus results](https://results.thecaucuses.org/)
- [World Inequality Database](https://wid.world/)




## Resources

Our textbook for programming is [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and for modeling is [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).

[R studio cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are a good place to start. [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) has a lot of good information, too, but probably more than you need. Here is a link to [all the cheatsheets in one pdf](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf).

Become good at Googling your problems.

These link to examples I mention in class, which might help give context for the kinds of data and analysis you can use in the project.
