# What you will learn

- ideas of programming
- for loops
- more on lists


**Main reference:** [R4DS section III](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/program-intro.html), chapter 21 on iteration, 20.5 on lists

**Resources**

- [visual example](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#lists-of-condiments) of list indexing from the textbook
- [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/bk00_vectors-and-lists.html) notes on vectors and lists

# What we'll cover
Only basic ideas needed to do data science applications we're interested in:

- functions
- loops and vectorization
- if/else statements

### For those with programming experience
Much will be familiar, and this section might be on the easy side. But you must become familiar with how R handles common programming tasks.

I encourage you to glance at the [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) book, for example the [metaprogramming](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/metaprogramming.html) chapter, to get a sense of the ways R is different from or the same as what you know.
### For those without programming experience
This might be trickier and will require some extra effort. It's worth it, since these ideas are relevant to many other programming languages.

# A week-long project

### Can a totally random March Madness bracket beat the odds?

- goal: a program that randomly selects an entire bracket
- learn what we need as we go


### More than one solution

- real goal: learn programming tools
- **we might solve a particular aspect of the problem in more than one way** to demonstrate different programming methods

### Think of another way?
- you might see more efficient or fun ways to do a random bracket
- **do it and share!**

# Goals when programming

### Repetition and consistency

- do the same thing many times
- in a consistent way each time
- possibly with different inputs, e.g. run a model on different datsets

### Makes sense to the computer

- correct syntax for the programming language
- e.g. arguments appropriate for the function called
- efficient use of computer power
- and of course: program actually does what you want it to!

### Makes sense to human readers

- people can tell what code does by looking at it
- spacing, naming, organization all facilitate clarity

**If your code is difficult to read, it's difficult to find and fix mistakes!**

---
# Steps in programming

### A rough guide

1. Understand the problem

2. Devise program to solve it

  a. what are inputs and outputs?
  
  b. what operations convert inputs to desired outputs?
  
  c. how will my program be used?
  
3. Test on simple cases

4. Find and fix errors

5. Optimize if needed

# A random bracket

### My problem

- I don't really follow basketball
- but I get peer pressured into making a March madness bracket every year
- **how can I generate a bracket year after year requiring as little mental effort as possible?**

This is not a predictive model! We don't care about being accurate; we just want a bracket.

### Programming problem

- inputs: tournament team names
- outputs: complete tournament bracket of results
- random selection of winners at each step
- meaning, toss a coin each game to determine who wins

---
# Core idea of the program
These should be the basic operations of our program

1. **Input** original tournament state of 64 teams

2. **For each round, do** the following

  a. **Select winners** randomly from the previous round
  
  b. **Return results** from the current round
  

We will ignore the play-in games.

---
# For loops
One of the easiest programming tasks to understand: **For each element in a vector or list, do something.**


### Example one

```r
for (i in 1:3){
  print(i)
}
```

```
## [1] 1
## [1] 2
## [1] 3
```

This says we want to run the operation `print` for each number `i` in the range `1:3`


---
### Example two

```r
x &lt;- runif(5)

for (k in x){
  print(k)
}
```

```
## [1] 0.2290339
## [1] 0.01129402
## [1] 0.8986735
## [1] 0.5701871
## [1] 0.7188916
```

Here we iterate over the elements in `x` itself. 

Notice that `k` in the `for ()` statement matches `k` in `print()`. It is a placeholder for an arbitrary element in the vector `x`

---
### Example three: saving output

What if we want to save the output? 

Need to create an empty placeholder object of the correct size and type for your output.

#### Squaring the vector `x` using a for loop

```r
y &lt;- vector(mode = "double", length = length(x))

for (i in 1:length(x)){
  y[i] &lt;- x[i]^2
}

y
```

```
## [1] 0.052456546 0.000127555 0.807614010 0.325113305 0.516805192
```

Notice how I **iterated over the index of `x`** here rather than its actual values.

# Recap

### Three components of a for loop

1. Output initialization
2. Looping sequence
3. Body

### Generic syntax
`out`, `N` and `body` are all placeholders. See examples above

```
out &lt;- ...        # output initialization

for (j in ...){   # looping sequence defined
  ...             # body
}

```

---
# More on lists

### So far

- create a list with `x &lt;- list(thing1, thing2, ...)`
- create a named list with `x &lt;- list(name1 = thing1, name2 = thing2, ...)`
- grab the `n`th element of a list with `x[[n]]`
- grab the element named `name1` with `x$name1`


### Qualities of lists

- flexible structure
- elements can be anything, unlike in a vector object
- similar objects exists in other programming languages

---
# More-complicated lists

```r
x1 &lt;- list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
x2 &lt;- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
x3 &lt;- list(1, list(2, list(3)))
```


&lt;img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5ba72e78f2df8568c1be82236659558b0e06904c/04521/diagrams/lists-structure.png" height="350" /&gt;

---
### Index subsets of lists with `[]`
Returns a list

```r
x1[1]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1 2
```


```r
x1[1:2]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1 2
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 3 4
```

---

### Indexing at multiple levels
`[[]]` returns an element of the list, in whatever type it has, e.g. a vector.


```r
x1[[1]]
```

```
## [1] 1 2
```

Just keep adding indices with appropriate indexing for the subsequent levels


```r
x1[[1]][1]
```

```
## [1] 1
```


```r
x3[[2]][[2]]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 3
```


---
### Example four: loop with lists

The only difference is in using `[[]]` instead of `[]` needed to index a list instead of a vector


```r
x &lt;- as.list(x)
y &lt;- vector(mode = "list", length = 5)

for (j in 1:length(x)){
  y[[j]] &lt;- x[[j]]^2
}

y
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 0.05245655
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 0.000127555
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 0.807614
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 0.3251133
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] 0.5168052
```

# Tourney picker

### Picking winners from matchups

A key element of our program will be picking one winner from each matchup.

To pick a winner by coin toss from teams labeled `1, 2` I do


```r
teams &lt;- c(1, 2)
sample(teams, size = 1)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

### Doing this for all matchups with a for loop

This is a reasonable, but definitely not the only, way to approach the problem

- avoid using team names by assigning each team a number
- put all matchups in a list
- each matchup is a vector of two numbers, representing the teams to face off
- sample one from each element at random and save the result

# Tutorial
I will walk you through this.

Create an html file that does the following

1. **Create a list** of matchups for teams numbered 1 to 6, where team 1 plays team 2, 3 plays 4 etc.  Each matchup should be a vector, e.g. `c(1, 2)` is the first element of the list.

2. **Using a for loop** randomly choose winners from each matchup, saving the output into a new list called `win`

3. **Display** the `win` list

---
### 1. Create the list
The list is small enough to do this manually, for now. Need to use `c` multiple times here, since creating list of vectors


```r
games &lt;- list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4), c(5, 6))
```

### 2. For loop

Copy the list for loop syntax above and modify it for this problem. Instead of `x` in that example, use `games`. Instead of `y` output use `win`.

In the body of the loop, use the `sample` function to select winners and assign them to `win` in the correct slot.

---
Output will be something like this

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 2
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 4
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 6
