# strings manipulation, part c: a bit more

---







# What you will learn

- searching from front, back
- matching one or the other pattern
- replacing patterns with `sub`, `gsub` and `str_replace`
- `str_extract`
- `str_split`

**Main reference:** R4DS ch 14.3

**Resources:**

- `?regex` help file
- [strings cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf)
- [regexone interactive tutorial](https://regexone.com/)
- [stringi package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/stringi.pdf) for `R` has many string manipulation tools, though the `tidyverse` functions tend to use them in the background anyway


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Why more regex?

#### Need to learn a few more tricks

#### The tutorial can't cover all of them, but the homework will cover more

#### Next time we will use what we learned to answer questions about the data

#### Hang in there


---
# Or, and searching from left, right

`^` before your pattern **searches from the left** of the string

`$` at the end of your pattern **searches from the right** of the string

`"pattern1|pattern2"` matches `pattern1` **or** `pattern2` 

#### Examples


```r
dummy &lt;- c("Oh why", "Oh why oh", "Why oh why, Bob, why?")
```


```r
grep("^[A-z]", dummy, value = T)
```

```
## [1] "Oh why"                "Oh why oh"             "Why oh why, Bob, why?"
```

```r
grep("[A-z]$", dummy, value = T)
```

```
## [1] "Oh why"    "Oh why oh"
```


```r
grep("oh why oh|why oh why", dummy, value = T, ignore.case = T)
```

```
## [1] "Oh why oh"             "Why oh why, Bob, why?"
```


---

```r
grep("^Oh", dummy, value = T, ignore.case = T)
```

```
## [1] "Oh why"    "Oh why oh"
```

#### Who can translate this regular expression?

Remember `?` when outside `[]` is the option to match zero or once

```r
grep("why[?]?$", dummy, value = T)
```

```
## [1] "Oh why"                "Why oh why, Bob, why?"
```

Think of the pattern being read from **right to left** when using `$`


---
# Replacing patterns

Useful in data cleaning to replace a certain *bad* pattern with another.

### Example: `DOB` from death penalty data

A sample looked like this


```r
dob &lt;- c("1952", "1949", NA, "04/10/1970", "7/11/1969")
```


#### Nothing we can do about missing months and dates, or the `NA`

#### Best we can do is to extract the year for the full dates

#### To put it in common format for analysis

---
# `sub` and `gsub`

Base `R` functions to replace a matched pattern with a string

- `sub` replaces the **first** occurence of the pattern
- `gsub` replaces **all** occurences of the pattern

### Syntax

```
sub(pattern_to_match, replacement_string, vector)
gsub(pattern_to_match, replacement_string, vector)
```

Can use `ignore.case` argument here as in `grep` function.

---
# `str_replace`

These functions work similarly to the ones above, so I won't demonstrate more.

The difference is you can have multiple pattern-replacement pairs. See `?str_replace` for details.

### Syntax

Replaces the first match

```
str_replace(vector, pattern, replacement)
```

Replaces all matches


```
str_replace_all(vector, pattern, replacement)
```
---
**Goal:** Remove the month and day pieces of `dob` entries, in other words 

- search for patterns of the form `xx/xx/` for some number `x`
- replace with the empty string `""`

#### What is the problem here?


```r
dob
```

```
## [1] "1952"       "1949"       NA           "04/10/1970" "7/11/1969"
```

```r
gsub("[0-9/]{3}[0-9/]{3}", "", dob)
```

```
## [1] "1952" "1949" NA     "1970" "969"
```

#### And here?

```r
gsub("[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/", "", dob)
```

```
## [1] "1952"      "1949"      NA          "1970"      "7/11/1969"
```

---
Easy enough to fix


```r
gsub("[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{1,2}/", "", dob)
```

```
## [1] "1952" "1949" NA     "1970" "1969"
```

same as


```r
str_replace(dob, "[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{1,2}/", "")
```

```
## [1] "1952" "1949" NA     "1970" "1969"
```

Actually, we could do this in several different ways.

---
# String extraction

Suppose we want to save *only* the matched patterns in our strings. A good tool is `str_extract` from the tidyverse.

### Syntax
Extracts the **first match** in each entry of the vector, **returning a vector of the matches**
```
str_extract(vector, pattern)
```

Extracts **all matches** in each entry of the vector, **returning a list** with the vector of matches for each entry

```
str_extract_all(vector, pattern)
```

### Note
We have not yet seen list objects in detail, so I will stick to `str_extract` for now.

---
# Examples

#### Failure to match returns `NA`


```r
dob
```

```
## [1] "1952"       "1949"       NA           "04/10/1970" "7/11/1969"
```

```r
str_extract(dob, "9$")
```

```
## [1] NA  "9" NA  NA  "9"
```


#### `NA` itself is not a string and matches nothing!


```r
str_extract(dob, "NA")
```

```
## [1] NA NA NA NA NA
```


#### Could have done the previous problem with this


```r
str_extract(dob, "[0-9]{4}$")
```

```
## [1] "1952" "1949" NA     "1970" "1969"
```

---
# Splitting strings

This is useful if we want to, for example, break up a string with several sentences into a vector with one sentence per element.

### Syntax
```
str_split(vector, pattern)
```

The option `n = x` sets a maximum number of pieces for the output to `x`. The default is unlimited.

### A vector of output for each cell
Since we are splitting each string in the vector, we will have a vector of the split pieces for *each* cell in the vector input.

The default is to return a **list** of the splits.

Option `simplify = TRUE` returns a matrix instead.

---

**Goal:** Split each line into individual sentences.

```r
dummy &lt;- c("There will be music.  Romantic candlelight, provided myself, and when the time is right, you'll confess your love.", 
           "So you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she agrees to marry you?   Oh, that is despicable.  I love it!")
```

#### Looking at one cell first: What's wrong?

```r
str_split(dummy[1], "[[:punct:]]")
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "There will be music"         "  Romantic candlelight"     
## [3] " provided myself"            " and when the time is right"
## [5] " you"                        "ll confess your love"       
## [7] ""
```

---
OK but awkward dangling empty split

```r
str_split(dummy, "[\\.?!]")
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "There will be music"                                                                          
## [2] "  Romantic candlelight, provided myself, and when the time is right, you'll confess your love"
## [3] ""                                                                                             
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "So you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she agrees to marry you"
## [2] "   Oh, that is despicable"                                                      
## [3] "  I love it"                                                                    
## [4] ""
```

---
#### Better to use matching modifier functions in many cases

from the `tidyverse`. For more see `?modifiers`

Subtle difference in how `boundary` works gets rid of the danglers.

```r
str_split(dummy, boundary("sentence"))
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "There will be music.  "                                                                      
## [2] "Romantic candlelight, provided myself, and when the time is right, you'll confess your love."
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "So you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she agrees to marry you?   "
## [2] "Oh, that is despicable.  "                                                          
## [3] "I love it!"
```

---
#### Could have split it into words as well


```r
str_split(dummy, boundary("word"))
```

```
## [[1]]
##  [1] "There"       "will"        "be"          "music"       "Romantic"   
##  [6] "candlelight" "provided"    "myself"      "and"         "when"       
## [11] "the"         "time"        "is"          "right"       "you'll"     
## [16] "confess"     "your"        "love"       
## 
## [[2]]
##  [1] "So"         "you"        "want"       "me"         "to"        
##  [6] "throw"      "her"        "father"     "in"         "the"       
## [11] "asylum"     "unless"     "she"        "agrees"     "to"        
## [16] "marry"      "you"        "Oh"         "that"       "is"        
## [21] "despicable" "I"          "love"       "it"
```

# Tutorial
Create an html file that does the following

1. **Read** the `beauty` dataset from last time, at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendanrbrown/brendanrbrown.github.io/master/beauty.csv
2. **Create** a new object called `narrator` with just the first row of the data frame, the narrator's opening lines.
3. **Replace** all of those semicolons in `narrator` with a single space, i.e. replace `;` with ` `
4. **Split** the result from 3. into its different sentences, and **display the result**
